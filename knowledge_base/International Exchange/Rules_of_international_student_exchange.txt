# Rules of international student exchange

International exchange programmes are open to persons holding the status of a
student, meaning persons enrolled in studies leading to the conferment of a
degree/awarding of a diploma ( _licencjat_ (≈Bachelor), _magister_ (≈Master),
_doktor_ (≈PhD) - both full-time and part-time). Regulations laying down the
rules of international exchange trips can be found

The criteria taken into consideration are the grade average for the previous
semester and the proof of competence in English at least at the B2 level. The
grade average may not be lower than 3.5.

If the grade average is lower than 3.5, it is necessary to obtain the relevant
Vice-Dean’s consent to the participation in the international exchange.

The host university will be assigned based on the documents submitted with the
application. A student may obtain 100 points in total:

\- 50 points for the grade average for the previous semester (e.g. 4.5 = 45
points)

\- 40 points for the level of competence in English (depending on the level:
B2 – 25 pts, C1 – 30 pts, C2 – 35 pts, native – 40 pts)

\- 10 points for the involvement in activities carried out for KU (from 1 to 3
points for one confirmed activity) – not mandatory
