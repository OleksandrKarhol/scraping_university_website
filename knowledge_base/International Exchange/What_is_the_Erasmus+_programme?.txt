# What is the Erasmus+ programme?

Erasmus+ is the European Unionâ€™s programme for education, training, youth, and
sports. Under Erasmus+, each KU student - after successful qualification - has
an opportunity to spend and complete part of their studies at a foreign higher
education institution who has signed a partnership agreement with KU, based in
one of the EU countries. The programme involves an exchange of students
between universities. Outgoing students do not incur fees at the host
university and have their stay partially financed from EU funds.  
  
The expected effects of mobility aim mainly to improve the competencies
specific to the profession to be taken up in the future and increase the level
of competitiveness of students as future employees on the labour market.
