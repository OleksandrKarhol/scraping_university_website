# Is there any financial support offered in the case of travelling to study in
non-EU countries?

KU receives funds for mobility to non-EU countries.  
  
Each year we receive funds for different different parts of the world and
different types of mobility. This is what grants for students depend on.  
  
Before the exchange, itâ€™s necessary to get information from the Outgoing
Students Coordinators
([outgoing@kozminski.edu.pl](mailto:outgoing@kozminski.edu.pl%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank))
on the current possibilities to obtain financial support.
