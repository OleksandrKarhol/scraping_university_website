# What is the PO WER programme?

Within the framework of Action 4.2 - Transnational Mobility Programmes under
the Operational Program Knowledge Education Development 2014-2020 (PO WER), we
run an exchange programme for students with disabilities and financially
disadvantaged students by enabling them to pursue a part of their curriculum
at a foreign higher education institution and co-financing a part of their
stay abroad. The aim of the project - like in the case of Erasmus+ - is to
improve the level of core and professional competencies of students.
