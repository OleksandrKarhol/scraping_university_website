# When can I go on an international student exchange?

 **In 2021, admissions are open from 01.02.2021 to 28.02.2021**

According to the Erasmus+ rules, it is possible to go on an exchange after
completing one’s first year of undergraduate-level (first-cycle) studies at
the earliest, i.e. in the second year of studies. Please bear in mind that you
should apply for the exchange much earlier, about half a year before the
planned leave for the exchange. To go on the exchange in the second year of
studies, it’s necessary to apply in the middle of the first year already. The
main admission process takes place in the first two months of each calendar
year, where students apply to go on an exchange in the following academic
year.
