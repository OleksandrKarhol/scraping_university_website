# Documents to be attached to the application for an assistance grant

The set of the said documents depends on the facts contained in the
application. While reviewing the application, the Committee always seeks to
confirm as much of the information contained in the application as possible –
by referring to the attached documents. If, for example, a change in one’s
life situation results from losing one’s job, it is necessary to attach a
certificate of employment and earnings; if it involves a family member’s
illness and extraordinary expenses – a certificate from the doctor/hospital
regarding the illness and e.g. doctor’s indication of the necessary
medications, as well as a record of expenses – e.g. receipts from the pharmacy
or the student’s declaration with a list of prices which can be checked on the
Internet.  
  
DOCUMENTS - COPIES AND ORIGINALS:  
Given the restrictions related to preventing, countering, and combating
COVID-19, it is acceptable to submit copies of original documents. However, at
the request of the Grants Committee or the Grants Appeals Committee, the
student will be obliged to present the original documents if necessary.  
If you submit your application in person, you may be asked to present the
original of the submitted copied document for inspection.
