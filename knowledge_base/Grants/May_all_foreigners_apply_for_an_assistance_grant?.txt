# May all foreigners apply for an assistance grant?

  1. No.  
  
The right granted to foreigners to apply for state-funded scholarships and
grants (including assistance grants) depends on e.g. the date of commencement
of studies.  
  
Foreigners who started their studies in the academic year 2019/2020 or later
have the right to apply for an assistance grant following the principles
defined in Article 324 of the Act of 20 July 2018 Law on Higher Education and
Science – which means that every foreigner may apply for an assistance grant
on the same terms as Polish citizens.  
  
Foreigners who started their studies before the academic year 2019/2020 have
the right to apply for an assistance grant following the principles defined in
Article 43 of the Act of 27 July 2005 Law on Higher Education – only if they
belong to one of the following groups:  
  
1\. non-nationals who have been granted a residence permit;  
2\. non-nationals who hold refugee status as granted by the Republic of
Poland;  
3\. non-nationals who have been granted temporary protection in the territory
of the Republic of Poland;  
4\. migrant workers who are nationals of a Member State of the European Union,
the Swiss Confederation, or a member state of the European Free Trade
Association (EFTA) – parties to the Agreement on the European Economic Area,
as well as members of their families if residing in the territory of the
Republic of Poland;  
5\. non-nationals who have been granted a European Community long-term
residence permit in the territory of the Republic of Poland;  
6\. non-nationals who have been granted a fixed-term residence permit in the
territory of the Republic of Poland pursuant to the circumstances referred to
in Article 127, Article 159, section 1 or Article 186, section 1, item 3 or 4
of the Act of 12 December 2013 on foreigners (Journal of Laws of the Republic
of Poland of 2016, item 1990, 1948, and 2066, and of 2017, item 60, 858, and
1543);  
7\. non-nationals who have been granted subsidiary protection in the territory
of the Republic of Poland;  
8\. nationals of a Member State of the European Union or a member state of the
European Free Trade Association (EFTA) – parties to the Agreement on the
European Economic Area or the Swiss Confederation, as well as members of their
families, having the right of permanent residence;
