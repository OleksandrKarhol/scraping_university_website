# KU Mailbox

On 15 May 2012, the existing mailbox offered to students and employees of
Kozminski University was replaced by a Microsoft solution. From that day on,
as part of the access to Office 365 service, each student and employee of KU
could use a completely free e-mail account with @kozminski.edu.pl domain and
50 GB of storage, and access to OneDrive with 1 TB of storage. The account is
also active after graduation.  
  
• LOGGING IN  
There are several ways to access your e-mail account:  
1\. Through the Outlook Web App application, which is linked to the home page
of Kozminski University

  
  
![](/servlet/rtaImage?eid=ka02o000000Ef6G&feoid=00N2o000008tiW7&refid=0EM2o000000whso)  
  
  

or by typing the address directly into the address bar of your web browser:  
mail.kozminski.edu.pl  
In order to log in to your mailbox through the website, the fields in the form
must be filled in as follows:  
• USERNAME:
[student_ID_number@kozminski.edu.pl](mailto:student_ID_number@kozminski.edu.pl)
or [course_participant_number@kozminski.edu.pl]()

Mail application on Apple computers and devices, etc.) after setting it up as
