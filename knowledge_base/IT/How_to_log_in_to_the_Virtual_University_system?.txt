# How to log in to the Virtual University system?

In order to log in to the Virtual University system, you need to go to
[wu.kozminski.edu.pl](http://wu.kozminski.edu.pl). In the ID field, enter your
student ID number (in the case of participants of postgraduate programmes, it
is the course participant number) and the password to your student account.  
  
 **I have trouble logging in to Virtual University.**  
Problems with access to Virtual University may be caused by several reasons.
For example, the message “Wrong username or password” may be result from
entering incorrect log-in data. Please make sure that you enter the correct
login and password when logging in. Additionally, please remember to enter
only the student ID/course participant number in the “ID” field, e.g.:  
\- First- and second-cyclde studies: 12345  
\- Doctoral studies: 123-sd  
\- Postgraduate studies: 12345-ckp  
If you log in for the first time using the starter password from your student
ID card/course participant card, please remember to rewrite the client number
from the back of the card without the last digit. The password consists only
of the first 12 digits of this number. The card is printed with 13 digits. The
last one is a check sum, which makes it possible to confirm the correctness of
the client code printed.  
If you forget your current password, you can set a new one using form no. 2
found at password.kozminski.edu.pl. To this end, you will need the
abovementioned client number found on the back of your student ID card/course
participant card.

During the password change you may also get a message that you don’t have an
account in the system. In this situation you should contact our IT Department.
This problem happens when an error occurs during automatic user account
creation. An IT employee must then create such an account manually.  
Another problem that you may experience while logging into the Virtual
University system is your account becoming locked in VU by a student office’s
employee. Such a situation occurs, for example, when you haven’t paid the
tuition fees or haven’t paid for a repeated course. Then, the account can only
be unlocked at the student office.  
  
You’re most welcome to contact us if you have any questions.
