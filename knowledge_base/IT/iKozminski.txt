# iKozminski

iKozminski is an application designed especially for the community of
Kozminski University - applicants for admission to the university, students,
graduates, and employees.  
  
It is a source of a lot of useful information. The information includes news,
events, job offers, and much more. However, its greatest advantage is the
possibility to use it to manage the course of study as it provides access to
the most important information for the student: the schedule of classes,
grades, and course materials.  
  
iKozminski is also a useful tool for KU’s faculty members, administrative
staff, and guests. The application features maps which make it possible to
find the room you may be looking for on KU’s premises.  
  
The application is modifiable. It means that its home screen can be customised
to your needs. Most features of iKozminski can be added to the home screen,
where they will appear in the form of widgets. This is very useful because
some sections offer then additional features. In this case, the schedule of
classes will display the schedule for the current day, and the library section
will display the number of books currently borrowed. This will let you to
adjust the application to what you may need at the moment.  
  
Moreover, the application has a notification function, which will inform you
about new announcements published in the Virtual University system, grades
added, and changes in the status of any pending decisions.

 **Frequently asked questions:**  
  
1\. I can’t log in to the application. What should I do?  
o Make sure if the login details are correct - check both the login and the
password. Check if you can log in to the Virtual University system on a
desktop computer.  
o If it turns out that all data is correct and you are logging in on your
computer without any problems, please contact the IT Department - room A115  
2\. I have the impression that some data reaches the application with some
delay. I have to wait some time before the information from the Virtual
University system in the computer version appears in the mobile application.  
o Certain information can be displayed with a delay – this is because of the
structure of the system, where information entered in our office computer
system is transferred to the mobile application with a delay of several
minutes. The delay results from the need to cache data before it is sent to
mobile applications. This way, we have a chance to catch incorrect information
before it is sent. The longest normal delay that can occur is 30 minutes.  
3\. I have a tablet with Windows 8. Can I install iKozminski on it?  
o Unfortunately, at the moment, the application is not available for computers
with Windows operating systems. The application is only available on iOS,
Android, and Windows Phone operating systems.  
4\. I found an error in the application - what should I do?

The development of the application is a very complicated process and we may
have overlooked some errors. Please report any problems you have found to the
IT Department at [help@kozminski.edu.pl](mailto:help@kozminski.edu.pl).  
  
You’re most welcome to contact us if you have any questions.
