The “SPINKA” Process, Project, and Change Management Scientific Club was
established in 2012. The name (translated into: ‘pin’) means that the concepts
which the club deals with form a single consistent system that ‘pins together’
the most important management-related issues.

The club’s mission is, among others, to help its members broaden the
theoretical knowledge on project management, processes, and changes taking
place in organizations. Moreover, there is also an emphasis on the development
of skills in the field of project, process, and change management by getting
involved in a range of research initiatives. The club’s main focus is to teach
using theoretical knowledge in practice!
