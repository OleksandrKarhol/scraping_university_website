The BIZ.com Student Scientific Club brings together Kozminski University
students interested in mastering and continuously improving their ability to
communicate effectively in business.

The scope of the club’s activity includes e.g. promoting the idea of effective
business communication, developing the efficiency of effective business
communication in the field of various communication techniques, and conducting
research of the influence of cultural differences on business communication in
foreign languages.

There are also analyses of the form and content of business communication
performed.

Members of the club improve their language skills in the field of translating
business texts and everyday business communication as well as develop their
individual research interests within the framework of business communication.
