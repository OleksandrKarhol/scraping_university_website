TIGER Students' Scientific Club of Economics, Politics and Society affiliated
to the TIGER Scientific and Research Center.  
The club is interdisciplinary; we focus on the problems of the modern world in
the era of globalization and try to answer the questions of what, how and why
and how to solve the problems of the present time. We place particular
emphasis on economics, entrepreneurship, social relations and geopolitics. It
is a circle created by and for students. We are not afraid to take up
controversial topics, ask difficult questions, and put forward bold theses.
