The problem of the Polish education system is the excessive dogmatic approach
to certain issues, as well as teaching things that became a thing of the past
long ago. When developing our Student Legal Clinic, we follow a completely
different approach.  
**The KU Student Legal Clinic is the number 1 legal clinic according to
Rzeczpospolita’s 2020 Ranking of Faculties of Law**  
Our Student Legal Clinic operates on a pro bono basis. Legal advice is offered
here to those worse off, who cannot afford the services of a law firm.
Students learn by dealing with case studies. They look for solutions to
specific legal problems. The Clinic draws up legal opinions and submissions.
These activities are a proper form of preparation to pursuing legal
professions. Students have an opportunity to get to know the ropes of working
with clients. The KU College of Law offers special psychological training to
the members of the Clinic, which involves teaching the basic skills required
to work with clients – including so-called difficult clients.  
 **The following sections operate within the framework of the Student Legal
Clinic:**

  * • administrative law
  * • criminal law
  * • civil law (three sections, including a family law section)

  * • labour and social security law
