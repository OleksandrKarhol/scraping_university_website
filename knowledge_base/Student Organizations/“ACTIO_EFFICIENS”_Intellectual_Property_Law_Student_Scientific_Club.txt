Are you interested in financial accounting and auditing? Are you planning to
pursue a career in this field?  
  
The “Actio Efficiens” club aims at increasing students’ awareness regarding
the ubiquity of intellectual property law by demonstrating instances of its
presence and significance in their everyday life.  
  
Intellectual property law, which includes copyright and related rights, as
well as industrial property law, is a vast, dynamic and fast-developing branch
of law, which makes knowledge thereof extremely sought after on the law
market.  
  
The club’s supervisor and board aim to make its meetings beneficial for the
participants – thanks to inspiring discussions and short presentations, the
club’s members have a chance to both deepen the knowledge in the field of
intellectual property law and develop their public presentation skills. “Actio
Efficiens” is open to all students interested in the subject matter in
question, regardless of their level of knowledge, field of study, year of
studies, or age.
