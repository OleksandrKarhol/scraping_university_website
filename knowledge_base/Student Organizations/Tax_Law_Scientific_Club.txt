The mission of the Tax Law Student Scientific Club is to bring together
students interested in the subject of taxes in the field of national,
European, and international law, as well as to demonstrate and highlight the
presence of taxes and their fundamental importance in everyday life.

Tax law is a dynamic and intensively developing field of law, which is
reflected in the level of interest of specialists in this discipline on the
legal market. Regular meetings of the club take into account the broad
interests of its members. Students have an opportunity to talk about their
tax-related interests through presentations and discussions.

The Tax Law Scientific Club brings together students of both law and economics
interested in tax-related issues.
