Ex Ante (Latin for ‘in advance’) brings together individuals who are now ready
to enter the world of legal problems they may face one day in the future. We
place emphasis on practical knowledge, where laws are the basis of solutions,
not the essence of problems. This way, we get to know the best procedures and
methods of acting in situations of legal conflict. Through our meetings, we
try to present law as an interesting aspect of life and convince young people
that it is not limited to learning regulations, norms, and decrees by heart.
We do our best to show the ways in which one can interpret law in everyday
situations and learn to notice the numerous legal structures among the
organizations that form our environment.
