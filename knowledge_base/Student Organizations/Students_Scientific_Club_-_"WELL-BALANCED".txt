The club was founded to associations of students who want to work on the
development of their competence. By sustainable development we understand the
balance between various aspects of human functioning in society and in the
organization. We combine theory with practice in many different fields of
science. The club carries out projects and studies interdisciplinary. Through
meetings with people involved in science or business, and cooperation with
companies we gain practical knowledge on sustainable development.  
Our name, "well-balanced" indicates a move towards sustainable development of
the organization and the balance between work and private life. The group's
activities focus on highlighting the fact that interdisciplinary and broad
horizons based on personal competencies are very important in managing a
thriving organization.
