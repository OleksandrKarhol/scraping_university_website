We are a medical and pharmaceutical law student scientific club. Our
activities focus on scientific and research work carried out mainly in the
field of medical law and on related matters, with the aim to popularise
knowledge in this area by e.g. organising regular meetings, workshops,
conferences, scientific sessions, training sessions, as well as by publishing
the results and findings of studies and projects conducted by the members of
our club.
