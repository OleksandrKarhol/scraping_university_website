# Doing an Erasmus+ internship or traineeship abroad - rules of mobility

 **1\. Students and Graduates (Recent Graduate) may receive a grant within the
framework of the Erasmus+ programme.**

  
A person intending to apply for the grant needs to meet the following
criteria:

• officially be a KU student (active student status) or graduate,  
• have an invitation from the company/organisation accepting interns or an
e-mail confirmation of being accepted for the internship in a given period,  
• have parts A and C of the Learning Agreement filled in,  
• the internship programme needs to be at least 2 months long,  
• the profile of the internship programme needs to be correlated with one’s
field of study pursued at KU,  
• have the approval of the Proxy for Internships.

**2\. Mobility capital**

  
Each KU student has a so-called mobility capital – a specific number of months
which they can spend abroad as an Erasmus+ grant holder within the framework
of a given level of studies:

**12 months** – bachelor’s studies, second-cycle master’s studies, doctoral
studies

**24 months** – single-cycle master’s studies (law)

The available mobility capital can be used by studying abroad, taking part in
an internship programme abroad, or by combining the two options.

KU awards Erasmus+ grants to its students and graduates for a period of **at
least 2 months** to serve an internship abroad/take part in a graduate
traineeship programme abroad in the countries of the EU and EEA as well as in
Serbia, Turkey, and North Macedonia.

**3\. Where to do the internship/traineeship**  

Internship needs to be done at a company based in an EU country. The list of
KU’s partner companies is available at the link
[here](https://mykozminski.force.com/s/article/Oferta-mi%C4%99dzynarodowych-
praktyk-Erasmus?language=en); it is also possible for students/graduates to
suggest a different company, one not included in the list.

The amounts of grants depend on the country the student/graduate chooses to go
to.
