# How can I apply for an Erasmus + international internship programme?

The crucial stage in the process of going for an internship abroad is the
selection of the organisation you wish to gain your professional experience
with. The internship base features a list of KU partner companies working with
the university as co-organisers of internship programmes for students and
graduates, but the person interested in taking part in an internship abroad
may choose a different company/institution/organisation, one not listed on the
said list.  
The most important thing is for the internship programme to be in line with
the field of study pursued at KU.  
Once you are accepted to take part in the internship programme by the
organisation you have chosen, you need to contact KUâ€™s International
Internships Coordinator
([marzenai@kozminski.edu.pl](mailto:marzenai@kozminski.edu.pl%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank))
and provide the details of the chosen organisation and the period of your
internship. The Coordinator will manage the further part of the process of
your taking part in an internship abroad.
