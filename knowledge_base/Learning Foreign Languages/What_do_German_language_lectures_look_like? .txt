# What do German language lectures look like?

In the case of the German, the main program premise for lower-level groups is
the mastery of a general language with elements of a specialized language,
with students preparing for the certificate exams as part of their coursework.
The program premise for groups with higher levels is the mastery of a
specialized language and preparation for the Goethe-Test Pro exam. The Geothe-
Test Pro and Ã–SD certificate exams that we offer our students are widely
recognized and valued by employers, and students have the opportunity to take
them at KU in our Examination Centers.  
  
 ****  
The German language course taken within the framework of full-time studies
comprises 90 hours of classes, which are spread over the first three semesters
of first-cycle studies. Learning is possible at all levels, from A0 to C2. At
the end of the first and second semester, students are to pass the course with
a grade. The third semester ends with an internal or certified exam, taken at
KU.
