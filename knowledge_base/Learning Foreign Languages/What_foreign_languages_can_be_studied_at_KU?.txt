# What foreign languages can be studied at KU?

Kozminski University offers the opportunity to learn seven languages:

English, German, French, Spanish, Russian, Chinese, and Polish as a foreign
language.  
  

Full-time students learn two languages:

· English

· a second foreign language of the student’s choice  

Students can choose from the following languages:

· German, French, Spanish, Russian - at least at pre-intermediate levels

· German or Chinese - at beginner's level  
  

Part-time students learn one foreign language.

Law students learn English as a foreign language.

Students from other faculties may choose English or German (provided there is
a sufficient number of students).

Foreigners studying at KU in English have the possibility to learn Polish.  
  

**Who teaches foreign languages at KU?**

Kozminski Language Centre is a team of top-class teachers and lecturers. They
are the authors of general and specialised language textbooks, e-learning
courses for Business English, language learning and testing applications,
articles, reviews and other publications.

Our teachers are practitioners – they apply effective teaching methods and use
a variety of teaching materials, such as latest language textbooks, their own
multimedia materials, and specialist authentic texts such as contracts,
commercial and legal documents, case studies and articles. They use new
technologies to teach and test foreign language skills.

All of our teachers improve their methodological skills by participating as
presenters at conferences, training sessions and seminars, and by
collaborating with international associations and organisations of English
language teachers, e.g., IATEFL, EULETA, the British Council, Cambridge
English Assessment and the Austrian Institute.

At KU, we run licensed language certification centres (TOLES, Linguaskill,
Goethe-Test Pro and ÖSD) where our students can obtain international
certification of their language qualifications. KU Language Centre carries out
research and pilot tests for certificate examinations, among others for the
British Council and Pearson.
