ÖSD certificates are documents proving one’s knowledge of the German language,
recognised in Europe and worldwide. The examinations have been designed and
are organised in accordance with the guidelines of the Council of Europe. They
can be taken by persons aged at least 16  
  
We encourage everyone wishing to have better chances on the labour market,
especially KU students.
