The GOETHE-TEST-PRO certificate exam is a computer-based exam and takes about
1.5 hours. It is an exam that automatically adjusts the difficulty level of
the questions to the capabilities of the exam-taker. It can be taken by people
with different levels of linguistic competence, starting from A1. It is a
general language exam with elements of language used in workplace
communication. The exam does not require any special preparation and is exam-
taker-friendly. The results and certificates are available immediately after
the examination. The German language exam can be taken in December (provided
that there is a sufficient number of exam-takers).
