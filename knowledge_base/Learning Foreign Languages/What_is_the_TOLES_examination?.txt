TOLES stands for TEST OF LEGAL ENGLISH SKILLS and is an exam in legal English.
You can take it on three levels:  
TOLES Foundation (level A2-B1)  
TOLES Higher (level B2)  
TOLES Advanced (level B2-C2).  
  
ALK students take the TOLES exam after completing their studies in the fourth
semester. KU students can choose between the TOLES Higher or TOLES Advanced
exams.  
  
The presentation of a TOLES certificate during the lectorate exempts students
from participating in the final exam.  
  
Most KU students choose the TOLES Higher exam and take it at our Examination
Center. The TOLES Examination Center has been in existence since 2004 and
boasts the best results achieved by candidates worldwide.  
TOLES exams focus on civil law issues, focusing mainly on company law
terminology, understanding of the language of contracts, but also on
terminology in labor law, tort law, the legal profession, banking. The subject
matter and scope of the examination was preceded by research in the largest
law firms in the world (with the so-called Magic Circle) and reflects the
language needs of lawyers working in an international environment and
communicating in English.  
The TOLES exams are also an excellent preparation for continuing studies in
courses and programs developing legal knowledge in English.  
There is no expiration date on the TOLES certificate, so there is no need to
repeat this exam.
