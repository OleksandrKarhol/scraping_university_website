# How can you benefit from LinkedIn Learning?

• Every student has received an activation link with individual access, sent
to their university e-mail address.

• If you don’t have such an e-mail address, request one by sending an e-mail
to:
[linkedin@kozminski.edu.pl.](mailto:serwis@kozminski.edu.pl%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank)  
We also offer consultation sessions to explain how LinkedIn Learning works. If
you’re interested, contact us at the address below.

You can also use a dedicated mobile app and watch courses offline. The app
makes it also possible to listen to courses in the podcast format. From now
on, you can learn while doing your daily chores.
