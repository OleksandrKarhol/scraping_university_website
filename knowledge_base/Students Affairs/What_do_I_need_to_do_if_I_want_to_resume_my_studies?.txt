\- in person at the student office;  
\- sent by traditional mail to the universityâ€™s address.  
  
Taking into account the courses passed earlier in the course of the pursued
studies, the Rector makes a decision on the conditions of readmission to study
(determining the year to which the applicant is readmitted and the courses to
be studied and paid for).  
In justified cases, the Rector establishes a framework of Individual
Organisation of Studies (IOS), determining in particular the curriculum
differences resulting from the programme of study adopted for the academic
year in which the student has been readmitted to study, and defining the
deadlines for passing the courses to be pursued as part of the said curriculum
differences.
