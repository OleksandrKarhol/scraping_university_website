# What is Kozminski Trio Basket?

Kozminski Trio Basket is a street basketball (streetball) tournament organised
in a sports hall. The competition is open to students of upper-secondary
schools from Warsaw and surroundings. The event was organised for the first
time in 2002. Since then, the number of participants has been consistently
growing. The last edition brought together over 100 teams of five each.

The tournament, based on fair play, is a spectacular sports event during which
every young competitor can feel like a professional player. Apart from the
games played in 3x3 teams, half-court-style, refereed by professional referees
from the top basketball league, the event offers also cheerleading routines
and slam dunk shows featuring the best slam-dunkers from Poland and the world.
Another welcome attraction is the ‘starter packs’ the competitors receive,
which include beverages, a tournament-themed T-shirt, some gadgets, and a
healthy and nutritious meal.

The best competitors receive a ‘pass’ to Kozminski University, KU Rector’s
scholarship, and a selection of in-kind prizes.
