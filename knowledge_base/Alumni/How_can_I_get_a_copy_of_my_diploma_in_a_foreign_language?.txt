At the request of a graduate, we can issue additional copies of the diploma,
translated into one of the following foreign languages: English, French,
Spanish, German, Russian, as well as additional copies of the diploma
supplement, translated into English.  
The documents are issued within 30 days from the date of submission of

upon the requesting graduate’s payment of a fee of:

  * **PLN 20.00** \- refers to students commencing their studies on 01.10.2019
  *  **PLN 40.00** \- refers to students commencing their studies before 01.10.2019 The fee should be paid to the graduate’s individual KU account number.

Graduates who received their diploma by 30.09.2019 should attach a current
photograph (4.5 x 6.5 cm) to their request for a copy of their diploma.
