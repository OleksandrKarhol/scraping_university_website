# How to receive an invoice for tuition fees?

  * Invoice issued to natural persons or sole traders (payments made from a personal bank account) are issued at the request of students/course participants. To receive an invoice, please send an e-mail with a request for such an invoice after making the payment to our Accounting Department: [oplaty@kozminski.edu.pl,](mailto:oplaty@kozminski.edu.pl%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank) phone no.: 22 519 22 28/72.
  * Invoices issued to businesses after the payment (payments made from business bank accounts) are issued automatically within 7 days from the date of payment, without any additional formal requirements to be met.
  * If you wish to receive a pro-forma invoice or a standard invoice issued to a company before the payment, you need to submit the relevant request - you can download the sample thereof [here](https://kozminski.sharepoint.com/:w:/s/file-storage-baza-wiedzy/EfJNbeLSxgdAsj02KWAX1JgBHUwLAqWksOq5KAJfPa_GPw?e=oDyeVu)

A scanned copy of the request filled in by the Employer needs to be sent by
e-mail to our Accounting Department:

Please send a complete set of details required to issue the invoice
(purchaserâ€™s details: name, address, NIP). With your safety in mind, we
encourage you to accept invoices sent by e-mail.
