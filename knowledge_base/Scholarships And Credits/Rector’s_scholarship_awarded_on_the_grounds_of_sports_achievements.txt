# Rector’s scholarship awarded on the grounds of sports achievements

1\. A rector’s scholarship awarded on the grounds of sports achievements may
be applied for by a student who **demonstrates outstanding performance in
sports competitions at least at a national level** in the academic year
2021/2022 (from 1 October 2021 to 30 September 2022) and who has been promoted
to the next year of studies (and a first-year student of second-cycle
studies). For example, the Academic Championships of Warsaw and Masovia **is
not** a national-level competition.

Centre include representing the university in competitions by being entered
into them by KU, as well as – in particular – one’s achievements published on
