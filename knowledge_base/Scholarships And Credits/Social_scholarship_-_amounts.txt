# Social scholarship - amounts

The system of benefits for students is based on funds coming from subsidies
provided by the Ministry of Science and Higher Education, awarded from the
state budget.

The amount of individual scholarships and grants in the academic year is
determined by the Grants Committee based on the amount of funds available and
the number of eligible applications.

An example of monthly amounts of maintenance grants (the grant amounts may be
different in particular academic years):  
in the academic year 2019/2020: maintenance grant = PLN 1,450, increased
maintenance grant = PLN 1,650  
in the academic year 2020/2021: maintenance grant = PLN 1,700, increased
maintenance grant = PLN 1,900  
in the academic year 2021/2022: maintenance grant = PLN 2,150, increased
maintenance grant = PLN 2,350  
 **in the academic year 2022/2023: maintenance grant = PLN 2,200, increased
maintenance grant = PLN 2,400**
