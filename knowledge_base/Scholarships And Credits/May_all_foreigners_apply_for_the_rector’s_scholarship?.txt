# May all foreigners apply for the rector’s scholarship?

No.  
  
The right granted to foreigners to apply for state-funded scholarships and
grants (including rector’s scholarship) depends on e.g. the date of
commencement of studies.  
 **Foreigners who started their studies in the academic year 2019/2020** **or
later** have the right to apply for the rector’s scholarship following the
principles defined in Article 324 of the Act of 20 July 2018 Law on Higher
Education and Science – which means that **every foreigner may apply for the
rector’s scholarship on the same terms as Polish citizens**.  
  
**Foreigners who started their studies before the academic year 2019/2020**
have the right to apply for the rector’s scholarship following the principles
defined in Article 43 of the Act of 27 July 2005 Law on Higher Education –
**only if they belong to one of the following groups:**  
1\. nationals of the Member States of the European Union, of the Swiss
Confederation, or the member states of the European Free Trade Association
(EFTA) – parties to the Agreement on the European Economic Area and members of
their families who have the funds necessary to cover their subsistence costs
during the period of study;  
2\. holders of a valid Polish Charter card (Karta Polaka)  
3\. non-nationals who have been granted a residence permit;

Republic of Poland;
