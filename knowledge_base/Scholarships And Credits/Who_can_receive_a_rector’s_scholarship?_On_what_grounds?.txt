**2\. A rector’s scholarship may be awarded to a full-time or part-time
student who has been promoted to the next year of studies and who, as a
student status in the academic year 2021/2022, could demonstrate:**  
1) an outstanding academic performance, which means achieving an arithmetic
average grade of at least 4.50 **** (an average of 4.50 entitles you to apply
for a scholarship, but does not guarantee its award), or  
2) sports achievements in a competition at least at a national level, or  
3) academic achievements, or  
4) artistic achievements.  
The grade average and the achievements need to date to academic year 2021/2022
(from 01.10.2021 to 30.09.2022).  
The Rector's scholarship is not semester-based and is awarded once per
academic year in October.  
  
3\. A student who repeated a year or a semester in the academic year 2020/2021
**MAY NOT** apply for a rector’s scholarship. ****  
  
4\. The grounds to apply for a rector’s scholarship involve the fulfilment of
at least one of the conditions listed above (for instance, it is possible to
apply for the scholarship on the basis of a GPA of at least 4.50 or on the
basis of one's sports achievements - as well as on the basis of both).  
  
5\. First-year students of second-cycle studies and first-year students of
single-cycle studies taken up upon completion of first-cycle studies may apply
for a rector’s scholarship on if they fulfilled the relevant application
criteria in the last year of their first-cycle studies in the academic year
2021/2022.  
  
6\. If the number of applications for a rector’s scholarship in a given field
of study exceeds 10% of the number of students pursuing this field of study,
the rector’s scholarship is awarded first on the basis of sports achievements
and a recommendation of the Sports Centre Director, and only then on the basis
of academic and artistic achievements.  
  
7\. If the number of applications for a rector’s scholarship in a given field
of study exceeds 10% of the number of students pursuing this field of study,
the Rector will determine the minimum arithmetic average for eligibility for
rector's scholarships by way of an official decision.  
  
8\. In each academic year, the final criteria for the award of a scholarship
are determined by the Rector, in consultation with the student government,
including, inter alia, the grade point average for eligibility. The grade
point average is influenced not only by the situation described in point 6,
but also by the number of applications and the state of financial resources.  
The criteria determined for a given academic year will be published on the
university’s website in the form of a Rector’s decision made in consultation
with the student council -
