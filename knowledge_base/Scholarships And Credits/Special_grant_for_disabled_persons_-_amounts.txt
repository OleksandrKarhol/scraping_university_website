# Special grant for disabled persons - amounts

The system of benefits for students is based on funds coming from subsidies
provided by the Ministry of Science and Higher Education, awarded from the
state budget.

Such a subsidy is awarded to a higher education institution by MSHE for a
calendar year, which means that in the academic year 2020/2021, our funds for
the period October - December will come from the subsidy for 2020, and the
funds for the period January - July will come from the subsidy for 2021, the
amount of which will be known in March 2021 at the soonest.

The amount of individual scholarships and grants in the academic year
2020/2021 will be determined by the Grants Committee based on the amount of
funds available and the number of eligible applications. In general, the
Committee diversifies the amounts depending on the degree of oneâ€™s disability.

An example of monthly amounts of special grants for disabled persons in the
academic year 2019/2020 (the grant amounts may be different in particular
academic years): PLN 450 (mild degree of disability) or PLN 620 (moderate
degree of disability) or PLN 850 (severe degree of disability).
