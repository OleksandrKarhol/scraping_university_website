# When and where should I apply for an assistance grant?

The request for an assistance grant should submitted immediately after you
find yourself in a difficult life situation. You can apply for assistance
throughout the entire academic year.  
Exceptionally, due to an epidemic and temporary change in the regulations, the
application for an assistance grant and documents may be sent as scans by
email until September 30, 2021. The email must be sent from the university
mailbox (from the address with the student's number), to
[stypendia@kozminski.edu.pl](mailto: stypendia@kozminski.edu.pl). The name of
the application file: "application_name" , the name of the file with a given
document should begin with its number (according to the number in the list of
documents in the application, e.g. "1_doc").  
  
You can also submit an application for assistance just like any other
scholarship application:  
  
 **1.** **by leaving them IN THE MAILBOX** labelled “stypendia”
(scholarships/grants) **in the front office area in building D** \- after you
leave your application in the mailbox, please send a notification of this fact
to [stypendia@kozminski.edu.pl](mailto: stypendia@kozminski.edu.pl). Only when
you receive a response confirming that the application has been received
(meaning taken out from the mailbox) will it mean that the application has
been accepted for consideration,  
OR  
 **2.** by sending them by **traditional MAIL** to the address of the
university, in an envelope with an annotation reading “stypendia”
(scholarships/grants) or addressed to Magdalena Skopiec (please send an e-mail
with information that the application for the assistance grant was sent by
traditional mail on ... (date)- to the email address above)  
OR  
only when it is absolutely necessary, the situation is complicated and needs
to be clarified before submitting the request is submitted  
 **3.** **IN PERSON** at the university (upon arrival to the front office in
building D, you need to inform the staff you have an appointment at the Office
for Scholarships and for Students with Special Needs; one of our employees
will come to you and handle your case at a student counter in the open space:
in the front office area); appointments can be scheduled only upon a prior
arrangement – [see the office’s working
