# Rector’s scholarship - amounts

The system of benefits for students is based on funds coming from **subsidies
provided by the Ministry of Science and Higher Education** , awarded from the
state budget.  
  
Such a subsidy is awarded to a higher education institution by MSHE **for a
calendar year** , which means that in the academic year 2022/2023, our funds
for the period October - December will come from the subsidy for 2022, and the
funds for the period January - July will come from the subsidy for 2023, the
amount of which will be known in March 2023 at the soonest.  
  
The amount of the rector’s scholarships granted in the academic year 2022/2023
is determined by **the Rector by way of an official decision made in
consultation with the student council** , based on the financial situation and
the number of applications that meet the conditions for application.
