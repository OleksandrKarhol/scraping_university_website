application. Please print appendix 5A, 5B, 5C, or 5D as a continuation of

possible).  
 **NOTICE:**

1\. Polish citizens are required to complete the application form in Polish. A
Polish-language version of the application form can be found in the
article:["Druk wniosku o stypendium
rektora"](https://mykozminski.force.com/s/article/Druk-wniosku-o-stypendium-
rektora?language=pl).  
2\. The grounds for application (appendix 5A/5B/5C) need to include a dean’s
(student service) office’s confirmation of the student’s grade average/status;
appendix 5B needs to include a recommendation of the Sports Centre Director
(Marek Wołkowycki) and the Sports Centre Director’s note confirming that the
student has achieved the reported sports results.  
3\. In the case of a student who submits more than one of the abovementioned
appendixes (e.g. 5A and 5B), one confirmation from the relevant dean’s
(student service) office (in appendix 5A) is sufficient.  
4\. Students who have a legitimate problem with obtaining confirmation from
the dean’s (student service) office/Sports Centre (e.g. studying at a higher
education institution abroad within the framework of the Erasmus programme,
the next session for part-time studies occurring after 15.10) can write to:
[stypendia@kozminski.edu.pl ](mailto:stypendia@kozminski.edu.pl)  
5\. In the case of a first-year second-cycle student who studied at another
higher education institution in the academic year 2021/22, the confirmation to
be included in appendix 5A/5B/5C must come from the relevant dean’s (student
service) office of the previous higher education institution (instead of a
confirmation in form 5A, the student may submit a separate certificate from
their previous higher education institution, but ONLY under the condition that
the certificate contains ALL the information required in forms 5A/5B/5C - the
certificate must make it possible for the committee to fill out forms
5A/5B/5C)
