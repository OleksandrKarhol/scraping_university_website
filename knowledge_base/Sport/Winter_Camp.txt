# Winter Camp

Kozminski Winter Camp is an annual camp organized in the Alps for all winter
madness enthusiasts. If you are skiing or snowboarding, this is the place for
you! Come with us, ski on white trails and integrate into the KU community!

At the camp there is a possibility to pass the Physical Education through
active participation in a ski or snowboard training.
