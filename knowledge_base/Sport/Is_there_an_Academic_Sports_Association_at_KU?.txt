# Is there an Academic Sports Association at KU?

An Academic Sports Association has been operating at Kozminski University
since 1995. Our students would initially play football and basketball, and
other sports sections were formed in each year that followed. Thanks to KU’s
authorities and a strong orientation on the development of sports, Kozminski
University Academic Sports Association sections has won many medals in
contests and competitions bringing together competitors from Warsaw, Masovia,
Poland, and the whole of Europe. Here’s a list of KU ASA’s greatest
