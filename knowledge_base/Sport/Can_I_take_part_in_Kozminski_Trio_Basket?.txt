# Can I take part in Kozminski Trio Basket?

Yes, you can if you are a student of an upper-secondary school. According to
the rules of the tournament, the event is open to teams composed of students
from the same school. Each team can be composed of 3 to 5 players. You’ll also
need to be accompanied by a coach or a teacher appointed as your supervisor by
your school’s authorities. More details can be found at:
[www.triobasket.pl](http://www.triobasket.pl/)  
If you’re a higher education student and would like to assist in the
organisation of the event, you’re also welcome to join us. Any voluntary help
is more than welcome. You can gain experience in organising a unique sports
event of this magnitude. If you’d like to learn more, get in touch with KU
