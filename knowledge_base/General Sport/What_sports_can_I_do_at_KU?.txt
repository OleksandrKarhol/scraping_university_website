# What sports can I do at KU?

We have football, basketball, volleyball, among others. Or maybe you’re
interested in something completely different? Regardless of which discipline
you’re most fond of, we always give you a chance to develop your sporting
passions and are open to your suggestions and ideas. Visit our Sports Centre
office (room D25) and tell us which sport you’d like to get involved in.  
  
In the present academic year, Kozminski University runs the following semi-
professional sports sections:

• men’s basketball  
• women’s volleyball  
• chess or duplicate bridge  
• e-sports  
• cheerleading.

You can also attend aerobics classes, do exercises for healthy spine, play
table tennis, learn self-defence or aikido. The university has a well-equipped
gym.

  
Each year we adapt the types of sections to the needs of our students.
