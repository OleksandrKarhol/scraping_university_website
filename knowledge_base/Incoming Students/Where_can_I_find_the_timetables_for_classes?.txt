# Where can I find the timetables for classes?

Timetables are available on the [Virtual
University](https://wu.kozminski.edu.pl/WU/Logowanie2.aspx%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank)
platform.

Prior to the registration, each student receives their individual credentials
to access the system. After that, students have a few days to get familiar
with the platform, check the class schedules, and plan their timetables.
