# What is the KU Mate programme?

Using the help of the [Kozminski International
Society](https://www.facebook.com/KUInternationalSociety/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank),
each semester, every incoming student can apply to get their KU Mate.

The person appointed as your KU Mate will:

  * help you arrange the accommodation and handle all other every day aspects of your stay in Warsaw,
  * possibly pick you up from the airport upon your arrival (a matter of individual arrangements),
  * show you around the city and the university, etc.

Taking part in the programme is possible only upon prior registration (the
Incoming Students Coordinator always provides students with the necessary
links and information).
