# Scholarship for non-EU students (ICM)

1\. The Erasmus scholarship consists of financial support for monthly expenses
(however, the amount is paid in two instalments) and a refund of travel
expenses - there is no option to receive any part of the scholarship
separately or to offer parts of the scholarship to be granted to different
students.  
  
\- General scholarship for individual expenses - each student qualified to
receive the financial support will receive 800 euro per month;  
\- Financial support for travel expenses - each eligible student will receive
financial support to cover their travel expenses depending on the distance
between their home university and KU:

**Journey distance**|  **Amount per participant**  
---|---  
Between 100 - 499 km| 180 EUR

2\. The first instalment of the scholarship will be paid within 30 days from
the day of signature of the agreement; it covers 70% of the total amount of
the scholarship.  
  
3\. The second instalment (30% of the scholarship) is transferred within 15
days from the day when the student submits the EU survey; the EU survey will
be sent by email by the European Commission not later than 30 days before the
