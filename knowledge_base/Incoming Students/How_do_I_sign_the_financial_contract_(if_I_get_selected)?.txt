# How do I sign the financial contract (if I get selected)?

1\. The financial agreement will be signed with the students after their
arrival to KU, at the beginning of their stay in Warsaw.

2\. The grant transfer will be made to either to:

  * the international account provided by the student (in such a case, the student has to be aware of the international transfer charges and the currency exchange rates, which may affect the final amount received), or
  * a EURO account opened in a Polish bank after the student’s arrival to Poland. At KU, there is a branch office of Santander Bank ([BZWBK](http://www.bzwbk.pl/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank)), where such an account can be opened. The offer will be • provided to students interested in opening the account in a Polish bank.
