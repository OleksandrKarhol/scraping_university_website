# Do I need to have a visa?

Depending on your passport you might need to apply for a visa to enter Poland.
Please check the visa requirements for your nationality before planning a
travel to Poland (European citizens can travel within the Schengen zone
freely): [gov
page](https://udsc.gov.pl/en/cudzoziemcy/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank).  
  
An important thing to notice is that most citizens are allowed to travel to
Poland for a stay of 90 days or less without having to obtain a visa. However,
bear in mind that your exchange period will exceed 90 days of stay, which
means you still may need to check the terms and conditions of the process of
legalisation of your stay as a student at KU in Poland depending on your
nationality. In such cases, due to the fact that your stay will be longer than
90 days, we suggest applying for a Student Visa (d-type).  
  
Please note that another type of visa - Schengen Visa ( **c-type** ) **would
not enable you to stay** for the whole period of your mobility in our country
as it is issued for cases of stay in the Schengen Area for less than 90 days
within each 180-day period; you can check additional information on [Poland’s
Ministry of Foreign Affairs’
website](https://www.gov.pl/web/diplomacy/visas%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank).  
  
 **Please note that after the arrival to Poland there is no administrative
possibility to apply for a visa, so it is advised to finalise the process
before coming to Poland** to avoid problematic situation of arrival without a
visa or without knowing how many days you could stay in Poland.
