# When do I need to fill in the Learning Agreement?

Your home university might have their own deadline for drawing up, filling in,
submitting the LA so you should check it directly with your coordinator.

At KU you will be asked to submit a filled in “Before the mobility” part of
LA:

  * Fall semester – by mid-October,
  * Spring semester – by mid-March.

However, if you filled in the document earlier, please don’t hesitate to send
it to the Incoming Coordinator at KU in order to have it verified and resent
signed.

The second part of the LA (“During the mobility”) should be submitted only if
you have made changes to your previous selection of the courses you have
registered for (those indicated in the “Before the mobility” part of the LA).

Deadlines to submit the “During” part will be as follows:

  * Fall semester – until the end of November,
  * Spring semester – until the end of March.
