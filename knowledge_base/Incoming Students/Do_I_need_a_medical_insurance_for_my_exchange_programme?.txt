# Do I need a medical insurance for my exchange programme?

 **Yes** , all Incoming Students are required to have a medical insurance in
case of an emergency.

  * In the case of EU citizens, they should submit a European Health Insurance Card valid for the entire exchange period. 
  * Non-EU students are asked to provide proper medical insurance recognizable in Poland, â€¢ covering the entire period of the exchange.

Your KU student ID card lets you get an appointment with a general
practitioner in a private clinic network as public sector health institutions
would be aimed for rather in emergency situations during your stay in Poland.
