# What is the procedure to apply for Erasmus+ non-EU (ICM) grant?

An incoming students from a partner university may receive the grant once
their home university provides Kozminski University with the following
documents:

  * list of students officially nominated to take part in the Erasmus + programme
  * individual information about the selected students regarding their GPA and activities involved in at the university
  * a motivational letter written in English by each nominated student.

2\. KU Grants Committee will verify the documents received from partner
universities and award grants to the best students. The Committee will review
the GPAs, the motivational letters, and the studentâ€™s activity. KU is obliged
to follow the grant limits indicated by the European Commission. There are
grant limits per each country (not per university).  
  
3\. The student selected by the Committee as eligible to receive the Erasmus+
grant will have to sign a financial agreement with KU (a sample of the
document will be provided to the selected student before the agreement is to
be signed).
