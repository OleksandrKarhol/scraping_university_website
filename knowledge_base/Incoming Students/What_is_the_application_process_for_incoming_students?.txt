# What is the application process for incoming students?

Incoming Students should be nominated for the exchange programme at Kozminski
University by their home universities first.

  * After being nominated to Kozminski by Partner University Coordinators, students are provided with detailed information regarding the admissions process by Kozminski Coordinator. 
  * Online application needs to be submitted: [here](https://rekrutacja10.kozminski.edu.pl/na/default.aspx)
  * The required documents include:

  1. Copy of one’s personal ID/passport;
  2. Copy of one’s medical insurance (in the case of EU citizens – please submit your European Health Insurance Card, which should be also valid for the entire exchange period; non-EU citizens are asked to submit a proper insurance document with a coverage in the amount of at least EUR 30.000);
  3. Passport-size photo in the JPG format;
  4. Student’s transcript of records;
  5. Copy of one’s B2 Certificate of English (TOEFL, IELTS, TOEIC, FCE, CAE, CPE, LCCI) unless the language of instruction set for the student’s curriculum is English or unless English is the student’s native language. We accept language certificates which confirm at least B2 level of English. Also, students can provide us with an official confirmation of their level of English – issued by their home universities.
