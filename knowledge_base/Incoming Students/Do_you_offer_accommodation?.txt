# Do you offer accommodation?

Kozminski University does not have on-campus accommodation, so we cannot
provide exchange students with accommodation in a dormitory.  
  
Exchange students are required to find accommodation outside of the campus
with the help of fellow students from KU (KU Mates) and the Incoming
Coordinator.  
  
However, to facilitate the process of finding a proper place to stay in Warsaw
for incoming students during their exchange semester, we provide incoming
students, before semester starts, with tips and advice regarding the search
for accommodation as well as direct offers for of partner real estate
agencies, private dormitories, and private flat owners that we work with.

students can be found**[

We also prepare contact groups for our incoming students to make direct
contact between all incoming students easier as it can be easier to find a
shared flat or roommates. Also, if students decide to apply for the Mate
programme, their Mate will assist them in finding the right place to stay in
Warsaw.
