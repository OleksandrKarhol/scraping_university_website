# What is a Learning Agreement?

A Learning Agreement is one of the most important documents related to
Exchange Programmes, where students include courses which they will attend
during their stay at Kozminski University.

The LA needs to be **fully** filled in (the student should fill it in with
their coordinator/professor/dean from their home university) and sent to the
Incoming Coordinator at KU in order to have it validated and signed.

**The LA is fully binding with 3 signatures on it** (student, home university
coordinator, and KU Incoming Coordinator).

Those students who havenâ€™t been provided with this document by their home
university should inform the KU Incoming Coordinator in order to receive a
specimen LA to fill in.

Submission of the LA is **mandatory** for all students.
