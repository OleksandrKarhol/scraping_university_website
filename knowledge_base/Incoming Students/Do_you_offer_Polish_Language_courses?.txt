# Do you offer Polish Language courses?

Polish Language course is offered only to exchange students, which is why the
classes are taught each semester on the elementary level of communication.

The idea of the course is to learn Polish language useful in everyday
situations and to introduce participants to Polish culture. We call the course
‘survival Polish’, so it is offered each semester at the elementary level only
to interested exchange students.
