# Do I have to pay for my studies at KU?

During your mobility at Kozminski University you continue the study programme
you have started at your home university, so any financial obligations may be
only settled between you and your home university when you pay for your
regular studies. At Kozminski University, exchange students do not pay any
tuition fees or any other kind of entry fees.
