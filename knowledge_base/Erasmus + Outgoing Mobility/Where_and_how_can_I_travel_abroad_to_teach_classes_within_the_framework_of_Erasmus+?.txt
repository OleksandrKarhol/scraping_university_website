# Where and how can I travel abroad to teach classes within the framework of
Erasmus+?

Below you can find general information about the available mobility
opportunities:

  2. Each faculty member can go abroad at least once per semester. Faculty members working also as administrative staff members can go abroad to give lectures/teach classes and take part in training courses alike.
  3. Priority is given to employees with short history of employment and who are first-time goers
  4. Minimum language proficiency level for faculty members – B2, recommended level – C1.
  5. It is not possible to extend the duration of stay in a non-EU 1. country.
  6. During a mobility programme, faculty members are obliged to deliver at least 8 hours of lectures
  7. Mobility can be taken advantage of throughout the year, taking into account the holiday breaks at the selected host university
