# Where and how can I travel abroad to take part in a training course for
administrative staff within the framework of Erasmus+?

Our International Relations Office offers our administrative staff members an
opportunity to improve their qualifications in an international setting within
the framework of two Erasmus+ programme actions; **Action KA 103 – to EU
countries** and **Action KA 107 – to non-EU countries**.  
  
Below you can find general information about the available mobility
opportunities:

  1. Employees may take part in staff mobility for training (STT), which includes: staff week, workshops, special courses, or the so-called “job shadowing”, meaning exchange of experience between universities
  2. Each staff member can go abroad at least once per semester
  3. Priority is given to employees with short history of employment and who are first-time goers

Minimum language proficiency level for administrative staff – B2.

  1. If an employee’s language proficiency level is below the required level, they may go abroad with a supervisor – a fellow employee from their or another department provided that this fellow employee meets the minimum language proficiency level defined above
  2. Mobility can be taken advantage of throughout the year, taking into account the holiday breaks at the selected host university
