# How to settle training or academic mobility within the framework of
Erasmus+?

To settle mobility, the following should be submitted to the Mobility
Coordinator:

  * mobility plan – signed by the employee, the KU Mobility Coordinator, and the coordinator from the host institution (scanned or original document)
  * confirmation of stay – signed by the coordinator, stamped, and printed on headed paper of the host institution
  * tickets with a proof of payment – in the case of travel by long-distance bus or intercity/international train
  * every employee returning from a mobility programme financed from Erasmus+ funds is obliged to fill in an online survey within 30 days from receiving the request to fill in the survey at the latest.

***Failure to fill in the survey and no response to further requests will
result in the obligation to return the full amount of the received grant.
