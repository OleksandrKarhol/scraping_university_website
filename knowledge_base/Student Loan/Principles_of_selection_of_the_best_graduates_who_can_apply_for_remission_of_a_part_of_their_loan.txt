# Principles of selection of the best graduates who can apply for remission of
a part of their loan

At an undergraduate/graduate/doctoral studentâ€™s request, their student loan
may be remitted:

  * in the amount of 50% - if the undergraduate/graduate/doctoral student has completed their studies or education at a doctoral school belonging to the group of up to 1%,
  * in the amount of 35% - if the undergraduate/graduate/doctoral student has completed their studies or education at a doctoral school belonging to the group of 1.01% to 5%,
  * in the amount of 20% - if the undergraduate/graduate/doctoral student has completed their studies or education at a doctoral school belonging to the group of 5.01% to 10%
  * of the best graduates of first-cycle/second-cycle/single-cycle degree studies or doctoral schools in a given academic year.

  
The application for partial remission of the loan should be submitted to the
lending institution together with a certificate from the university confirming
that the borrower belongs to a particular group of the best graduates of
first-cycle/second-cycle/single-cycle degree studies or doctoral schools.  
  
The loan may also be remitted in part or in full if the borrower is in a
particularly difficult life situation or if they have permanently lost their
ability to repay their financial obligation. The remissions are granted by the
minister in charge of higher education at the request of the borrower.

process of selecting the best graduates - the file will be available soon
