# Summer camp

Kozminski Summer Camp is an annual camp organised in September in the form of
sports, entertainment, and orientation events for first-year students admitted
to the university. It is an orientation/team-building camp during which
students have the opportunity to pass Physical Education and gain extra credit
for other subjects. Every year, members of KUâ€™s student council are involved
in the orientation events taking place as part of the camp. Join us and meet
your future fellow students. Details and registration form:
