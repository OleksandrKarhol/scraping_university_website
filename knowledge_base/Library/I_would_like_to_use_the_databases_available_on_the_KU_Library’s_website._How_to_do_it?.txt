# I would like to use the databases available on the KU Library’s website. How
to do it?

The databases can be used:

  * On the premises of the university

In order to use the databases available on the KU Library’s website, you just
need to connect to the wireless network on your own device, or use a computer
in one of the computer rooms found on KU’s premises.

  * Outside the premises of the university

To use the databases, you will need to set up a connection with a proxy
server. Instructions explaining the entire procedure step by step can be found
below:  
1\.
[Computers](https://pliki.kozminski.edu.pl/it/baza_wiedzy/eng/ProxyENG.pdf)  
2\. [Mobile devices with the Android operating
system](https://old.kozminski.edu.pl/fileadmin/user_upload/proxy_na_androidzie.pdf)  
Please note that after setting up the connection with the proxy server, your
Internet browsing experience will be limited. Only the database pages, the KU
homepage, and the KU Library website will remain accessible to you.  
Several of the databases that students may use are available only on the
premises of the university. Therefore, please make sure that the database you
wish to use outside the university actually is actually accessible this way.  
  
 **I have set up a connection to the proxy server, but I still cannot use the
databases. Why is that?**  
Once you have configured your connection to the proxy server, you still need
to log in to it. You can do this using the same data you use to log in to the
Virtual University system.  
We would also like to remind you that after setting up the connection with the
proxy server, your Internet browsing experience will be limited. Only the KU
homepage, and the KU Library website, the database pages, the Virtual
University system, the iKozminski platform, and the Google search engine will
remain accessible to you. If you try to access any other page, the following
message will appear:  
  
![](/servlet/rtaImage?eid=ka02o000000Eh8T&feoid=00N2o000008tiW7&refid=0EM2o0000021sms)  
  
  
This message does not imply no access to the database or a wrong
configuration, but means that the connection to the site is blocked by the
proxy server. Please make sure therefore if you are able to visit the homepage
of Kozminski University (if it loads correctly).  
  
You’re most welcome to contact us if you have any questions.
