# Can I still use the library as a graduate?

KU graduates can use the reading room on site on the same terms as those they
followed when they were KU students. They can also borrow up to 2 books for a
period of up to 28 days upon presentation of their KU Alumni Card (in order to
obtain such a card, you should fill in the form available
[here](https://mykozminski.force.com/s/article/Jak-zdobyÄ‡-Karte-
Absolwenta?language=en)).  
When on the premises of KU, a KU graduate can use the databases available at
KU. However, it is not possible to use these databases outside the premises of
the university (according to the agreements concluded with the providers of
the databases - only our **current** students and employees have such a
possibility).
