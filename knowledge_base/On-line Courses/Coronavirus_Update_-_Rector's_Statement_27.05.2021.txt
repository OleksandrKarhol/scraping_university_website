Dear Ladies and Gentlemen,

  
Due to the restrictions implemented by the government in the field of higher
education related to the current epidemic situation, the remote teaching mode
is extended until June 30th, 2021.

At the same time, I would like to inform you that with the loosening of
sanitary restrictions by the government on higher education institutions, a
full reinstatement of the KU campus is being planned.

Prof. Grzegorz Mazurek, Ph.D.

The Rector
