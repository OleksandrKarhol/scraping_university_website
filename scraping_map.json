EXCEPTIONS\ninclude situations of \u201clost income\u201d and \u201cearned income\u201d.  \nSpeaking in most general terms, \u201clost income\u201d and \u201cearned income\u201d are used to\nadjust and update the calculations made on the basis of the year 2021. If\nthere occur any changes regarding the income of an applicant\u2019s family members\ncompared to the year 2021 when the applicant submits their application (no\nsource of income which a given person had in 2021, meaning \u201clost income\u201d, or\nthe appearance of a new source of income which a given person did not have in\n2021, meaning \u201cearned income\u201d) - the calculations made on the basis of the\nyear 2021 need to be verified accordingly.  \nIf there has been a case of lost income in 2021 or after 2021, when\ndetermining the amount of income of a given person for 2021, lost income\nshould not be included in the calculations: the amount earned in 2021 from the\nsource of the lost income in question is not taken into consideration (NOTICE:\nnot every type of income may be considered as lost! - see: definition of lost\nincome).  \nIf there has been a case of earned income after 2021, it is necessary to add\nthe amount of the income earned in the month following the month in which the\nincome was earned to the amount of the monthly income of a given person\n(NOTICE: not every type of income may be considered as earned! - see:\ndefinition of earned income) - e.g. if a contract of employment was concluded\non 1 July 2022, the amount of \u201cearned income\u201d is the amount of the nett\nremuneration for August 2022.  \nThe point of reference is always the moment of submission of the application\n(until the moment of obtaining the decision). This means that e.g. if a family\nmember gained an income from February 2022 to August 2022 from a source they\ndid not have in 2021, it is not a case of \u201cearned income\u201d because this source\nof income does not exist anymore. Such an income will not be considered in the\ncalculations at all.  \n  \n **Until the committee analyses an application and issues a relevant decision,\nthe applying undergraduate/graduate/doctoral student is obliged to report all\nand any changes in the financial situation of their family (\u201clost income\u201d and\n\u201cearned income\u201d).**\n\n",

Based on the submitted applications for a rector\u2019s scholarship awarded on\nthe grounds of an **arithmetic average grade of at least 4.50** , the Grants\nCommittee draws up a ranking list for each field of study represented in the\nsubmitted applications. The ranking lists will include grade averages for the\nprevious academic year with the surnames of students, sorted by grade average\nin descending order.  \n  \n2\\. The grade average is calculated on the basis of the provisions of the\nStudy Regulations.  \n  \n3\\. The grade average is an arithmetic average, calculated on the basis of the\nsum of grades and graded assessments for all courses included in a curriculum\ndivided by the number of grades and graded assessments included in the said\ncurriculum \u2013 taking into account all \u2018fail\u2019 grades as well.  \n  \n4\\.

If the grading scale at the higher education institution where a student\nhas completed their undergraduate-level (first-cycle) studies or from which\nthey have transferred to KU is different from that adopted at KU, the\narithmetic average grade shall be adapted to KU\u2019s grading scale and calculated\nas follows:\n\n\u2022 it is necessary to determine the share (in percentage terms) of the highest\npossible grade average at the previous higher education institution\nrepresented the student\u2019s grade average (up to four decimal points),  \n\u2022 the same share (in percentage terms) should be determined for the highest\npossible grade average at KU \u2013 meaning for 5.00  \n\u2022 the obtained result, according to item 2), is the student\u2019s grade average\nrecognised at KU.\n\n  \n7\\. The student\u2019s grade average needs to be confirmed in their application by\nan employee of the relevant student office ( **any possible doubts regarding\nthe grade average need to be clarified at the student office before submitting\nthe application** ).\n\n8\\. The grade average that provides the grounds for a scholarship for a given\nfield of study in a given academic year will depend on the number of all\napplications for a rector\u2019s scholarship submitted and on the amount of funds\nthe committee will have at disposal.\n\nContact details: [stypendia@kozminski.edu.pl](mailto:\nstypendia@kozminski.edu.pl), phone: (22) 519 21 80,  \n  \nHow to apply for the 2022/2023 academic year -\n[here](https://mykozminski.force.com/s/article/Druk-wniosku-o-stypendium-\nrektora?language=en_US)\n\n",

[Scholarships And Credits](/s/topic/0TO2o000000ADxxGAG/scholarships-and-credits \"Scholarships And Credits\")\n\n# Income from agricultural holding\n\nOn 22 September 2022, the President of Statistics Poland (PL: GUS), pursuant\nto Article 18 of the Act of 15 November 1984 on agricultural tax (Journal of\nLaws of the Republic of Poland of 2020, item 333), announced the amount of the\naverage wage for work performed in individual agricultural holdings for 1\ncomparative fiscal hectare in the year 2021: **PLN 3288.00**\n\nIn order to calculate one person\u2019s income from an agricultural holding for the\npurpose of an application for a maintenance grant, it is necessary to multiply\nthe number of comparative fiscal hectares in the holding (or holdings or areas\nforming the holding altogether) which belonged to the person in question in\n2021 (the number shall be rounded to four decimal points) by the announced\namount of PLN 3,288.00, and then divide the obtained amount of the annual\nincome by 12 (months).\n\nThe amount of the annual income needs to be indicated in the statement of\nincome (item 3 of appendix 2). If e.g. both parents are the co-owners of the\nholding in equal measure, the student should indicate half of the comparative\nfiscal hectares (and, at the same time, half of the income from the entire\nholding) for each of them in the statement (appendix 2).\n\n**NOTICE! Only an area larger than 1 hectare or 1 comparative fiscal hectare\nis considered an agricultural holding.**\n\n**NOTICE! The certificate from the relevant Commune Office (PL: Urz\u0105d Gminy)\nneeds to state clearly that in the YEAR 2021, a given person was the owner of\nan agricultural holding of a given surface area. A certificate with a current\ndate, indicating that a given person is the owner of an agricultural holding\nof a given surface area is not enough; the point is to have the surface area\nof the holding as of the year 2021 confirmed! The amount of income from such a\nholding does not have to be indicated in the certificate.**\n\nAn owner of several areas needs to add up the number of comparative fiscal\nhectares.\n\n**When calculating the income from an agricultural holding, the amount of the\nhealth insurance contribution is irrelevant, it may not be deducted from\nincome.**\n\nIf you have any questions, please contact our Office for Scholarships and for\nStudents with Special Needs: ****[stypendia@kozminski.edu.pl](mailto:\nstypendia@kozminski.edu.pl)\n\n",

An\nincome that occurred throughout the entire year 2020and continues to this day\n(the source of income did and still does exist, e.g. a continuing contract of\nemployment) is not an \u201cincome earned\u201d; when calculating the monthly income of\na given person, the amount of this income needs to be divided by 12 (months).\n\n**An \u201cincome earned\u201d _in 2020_ \\- is an income that

        "Income from agricultural holding": "  1. [Scholarships And Credits](/s/topic/0TO2o000000ADxxGAG/scholarships-and-credits \"Scholarships And Credits\")\n\n# Income from agricultural holding\n\nOn 22 September 2022, the President of Statistics Poland (PL: GUS), pursuant\nto Article 18 of the Act of 15 November 1984 on agricultural tax (Journal of\nLaws of the Republic of Poland of 2020, item 333), announced the amount of the\naverage wage for work performed in individual agricultural holdings for 1\ncomparative fiscal hectare in the year 2021: **PLN 3288.00**\n\nIn order to calculate one person\u2019s income from an agricultural holding for the\npurpose of an application for a maintenance grant, it is necessary to multiply\nthe number of comparative fiscal hectares in the holding (or holdings or areas\nforming the holding altogether) which belonged to the person in question in\n2021 (the number shall be rounded to four decimal points) by the announced\namount of PLN 3,288.00, and then divide the obtained amount of the annual\nincome by 12 (months).\n\nThe amount of the annual income needs to be indicated in the statement of\nincome (item 3 of appendix 2). If e.g. both parents are the co-owners of the\nholding in equal measure, the student should indicate half of the comparative\nfiscal hectares (and, at the same time, half of the income from the entire\nholding) for each of them in the statement (appendix 2).\n\n**NOTICE! Only an area larger than 1 hectare or 1 comparative fiscal hectare\nis considered an agricultural holding.**\n\n**NOTICE! The certificate from the relevant Commune Office (PL: Urz\u0105d Gminy)\nneeds to state clearly that in the YEAR 2021, a given person was the owner of\nan agricultural holding of a given surface area. A certificate with a current\ndate, indicating that a given person is the owner of an agricultural holding\nof a given surface area is not enough; the point is to have the surface area\nof the holding as of the year 2021 confirmed! The amount of income from such a\nholding does not have to be indicated in the certificate.**\n\nAn owner of several areas needs to add up the number of comparative fiscal\nhectares.\n\n**When calculating the income from an agricultural holding, the amount of the\nhealth insurance contribution is irrelevant, it may not be deducted from\nincome.**\n\nIf you have any questions, please contact our Office for Scholarships and for\nStudents with Special Needs: ****[stypendia@kozminski.edu.pl](mailto:\nstypendia@kozminski.edu.pl)\n\n",

An\nincome that occurred throughout the entire year 2020and continues to this day\n(the source of income did and still does exist, e.g. a continuing contract of\nemployment) is not an \u201cincome earned\u201d; when calculating the monthly income of\na given person, the amount of this income needs to be divided by 12 (months).\n\n**An \u201cincome earned\u201d _in 2020_ \\- is an income that fulfils the following\nthree conditions collectively:**\n\n1\\. it occurred in the course of the year 2020, it had not existed since the\nbeginning of the year 2020 (e.g. an employment contract concluded on\n01.03.2020)\n\n2\\. it exists at present (the contract continues or there have been several\ncontracts concluded with the employer, and the current one is valid and\ncontinues),\n\n3\\. pursuant to section 2 \u00a7 5 of appendix no. 9 to the Regulations, the income\ncan be earned only by:\n\n1) finishing one\u2019s child care leave,\n\n2) obtaining an unemployment benefit or a compensation,\n\n3) becoming employed or taking up other gainful activity,\n\n4) obtaining an early retirement allowance, a teacher\u2019s compensation benefit,\na retirement pension or a disability pension, a family pension, a social\npension or a parental supplementary benefit referred to in the Act of 31\nJanuary 2019 on parental supplementary benefit (Journal of Laws of the\nRepublic of

social insurance for farmers or Article 36aa section 1\nof the Act of 13 October 1998 on the social insurance system,\n\n6) obtaining a sickness benefit, a rehabilitation benefit, or a maternity\nbenefit, granted after losing one\u2019s employment or ceasing to have other\ngainful activity,\n\n7) obtaining a parental benefit,\n\n8) obtaining a maternity benefit referred to in the provisions on the social\nsecurity for farmers,\n\n9) obtaining a doctoral scholarship referred to in Article 209 sections 1 and\n7 of the Act of 20 July 2018 \u2013 Law on Higher Education and Science;\n\nThe amount of an income that fulfils the above conditions (i.e. it is an\n\u201cincome earned\u201d in the year 2020) will be divided by the number of months in\nwhich it was gained, and not by 12 (months).\n\nAn income that does not fulfil the above conditions is not an \u201cincome earned\u201d,\nand its amount for the year 2020 will always be divided by 12 (months) (e.g.\nthe amount of maintenance received first on 01.09.2020).\n\n**An \u201cincome earned\u201d _after 2020_ \\- is an income that fulfils the following\nthree conditions collectively:**\n\n1\\. it occurred after the year 2020, it did not exist in the year 2020 (e.g.\nan employment contract concluded on 15.05.2021), 2. it exists at present (the\ncontract continues or there have been several contracts concluded with the\nemployer, and the current one is valid and continues),\n\n3\\. pursuant to section 3 \u00a7 5 of appendix no. 9 to the Regulations, the income\ncan be earned only by:\n\n1)

year 2020) will be added to the amounts of other\nmonthly incomes of a given person, calculated on the basis of the year 2020.\nThis is to be an amount for the month coming after the month in which the\n\u201cincome earned\u201d occurred \u2013 e.g. one's contract of employment was concluded on\n01.07.2021, so the month coming after the month of earning one\u2019s income will\nbe August, and the

Thus, the amount of income earned from this\nsource in 2020 is not included in the calculation of the monthly income of the\nperson who reports income lost. However, not every income, even though it has\nceased to exist for a person, can be documented as \u201cincome lost\u201d.  \n  \nWhat is important is what the income was, what its source was, and on what\nbasis it was earned.  \nIn accordance with section 1 \u00a7 5 of appendix no. 9 to the Regulations on the\nbenefits granted to students of KU in the academic year 2021/2022 (Student\nSupport Regulations 2021/2022), a loss of income may be caused only as a\nresult of:  \n1) gaining right to take advantage of a child care leave,  \n2) losing one\u2019s unemployment benefit or compensation,  \n3) losing one\u2019s employment or ceasing to have other gainful activity,  \n4) losing one\u2019s early retirement allowance, teacher\u2019s compensation benefit,\nretirement pension or disability pension, family pension, social pension or\nparental supplementary benefit referred to in the Act of 31 January 2019 on\nparental supplementary benefit (Journal of Laws of the Republic of Poland item\n303)\n\n5) becoming de-registered from the register of non-agricultural business\nactivity or suspending such an activity within the meaning of Article 16b of\nthe Act of 20 December 1990 on the social insurance for farmers (Journal of\nLaws of the Republic of Poland of 2019, item 299, as amended) or Article 36aa\nsection 1 of the Act of 13 October 1998 on the social insurance system\n(Journal of Laws of the Republic of Poland of 2019, item 300, as amended),  \n6) losing one\u2019s sickness benefit, rehabilitation benefit, or maternity\nbenefit, granted after losing one\u2019s employment or ceasing to have other\ngainful activity,  \n7) losing one\u2019s court-awarded maintenance benefits as a result of death of the\nperson obliged to pay such benefits or losing one\u2019s cash benefits paid due to\nineffective enforcement of maintenance as a result of death of the person\nobliged to pay the maintenance benefits,  \n8) losing one\u2019s parental benefit,  \n9) losing one\u2019s maternity benefit referred to in the provisions on the social\nsecurity for farmers,  \n10) losing one\u2019s doctoral scholarship referred to in Article 209 sections 1\nand 7 of the Act of 20 July 2018 \u2013 Law on Higher Education and Science;  \n11) having one\u2019s earnings made from employment or other gainful activity\nreduced or having one\u2019s income from non-agricultural business activity reduced\ndue to counteracting COVID-19.  \n12) loss of the solidarity allowance granted to counteract the negative\neffects of COVID-19\n\n  \n  \nOn account of the above, e.g. an income from maintenance may not be treated as\n\u201cincome lost\u201d if the person obliged to pay it is alive.

Even though a person no longer receives this kind of income at\npresent, the amount of income earned in 2020 must be taken into account when\ncalculating the monthly income. On the other hand, if e.g. a given person\nworked for the whole year 2020 in company X based on a contract of mandate or\nan employment contract, and the contract was terminated in 2020 or after 2020,\nthe income from 2020 (e.g. PLN 26,300.00 indicated in the PIT-11 form and in\nthe tax office certificate of income) is not taken into account in the\ncalculations and the monthly income of that person is PLN 0.00.  \n **NOTICE!**  \nThe provisions on losing and earning income do not apply to income from\nemployment or other gainful activity and to income from de-registration or\nstarting a non-agricultural business activity if a family member has lost\ntheir income gained in any of the said ways and has earned income from the\nsame employer/mandator/ordering party or has taken up non-agricultural\nbusiness activity again within 3 months from the date of loss of income,  \n  \nIf you have any questions, please contact:\n[stypendia@kozminski.edu.pl](mailto: stypendia@kozminski.edu.pl)\n\n",

Based on the submitted applications for a rector\u2019s scholarship awarded on\nthe grounds of an **arithmetic average grade of at least 4.50** , the Grants\nCommittee draws up a ranking list for each field of study represented in the\nsubmitted applications. The ranking lists will include grade averages for the\nprevious academic year with the surnames of students, sorted by grade average\nin descending order.  \n  \n2\\. The grade average is calculated on the basis of the provisions of the\nStudy Regulations.  \n  \n3\\. The grade average is an arithmetic average, calculated on the basis of the\nsum of grades and graded assessments for all courses included in a curriculum\ndivided by the number of grades and graded assessments included in the said\ncurriculum \u2013 taking into account all \u2018fail\u2019 grades as well.  \n  \n4\\. The arithmetic average of grades is calculated rounded mathematically to\n**two decimal points** based on the third decimal digit  \n  \n5\\. The arithmetic average of grades **does not include** the grades obtained\nfor one\u2019s thesis and diploma examination.  \n  \n6\\. If the grading scale at the higher education institution where a student\nhas completed their undergraduate-level (first-cycle) studies or from which\nthey have transferred to KU is different from that adopted at KU, the\narithmetic average grade shall be adapted to KU\u2019s grading scale and calculated\nas follows:\n\n\u2022 it is necessary to determine the share (in percentage terms) of the highest\npossible grade average at the previous higher education institution\nrepresented the student\u2019s grade average (up to four decimal points),  \n\u2022 the same share (in percentage terms) should be determined for the highest\npossible grade average at KU \u2013 meaning for 5.00  \n\u2022 the obtained result, according to item 2), is the student\u2019s grade average\nrecognised at KU.\n\n  \n7\\. The student\u2019s grade average needs to be confirmed in their application by\nan employee of the relevant student office ( **any possible doubts regarding\nthe grade average need to be clarified at the student office before submitting\nthe application** ).\n\n8\\. The grade average that provides the grounds for a scholarship for a given\nfield of study in a given academic year will depend on the number of all\napplications for a rector\u2019s scholarship submitted and on the amount of funds\nthe committee will have at disposal.\n\nContact details: [stypendia@kozminski.edu.pl](mailto:\nstypendia@kozminski.edu.pl), phone: (22) 519 21 80,  \n  \nHow to apply for the 2022/2023 academic year -\n[here](https://mykozminski.force.com/s/article/Druk-wniosku-o-stypendium-\nrektora?language=en_US)\n\n",

In general, the\nCommittee diversifies the amounts depending on the degree of one\u2019s disability.\n\nAn example of monthly amounts of special grants for disabled persons in the\nacademic year 2019/2020 (the grant amounts may be different in particular\nacademic years): PLN 450 (mild degree of disability) or PLN 620 (moderate\ndegree of disability) or PLN 850 (severe degree of disability).\n\nIf you have any questions, please contact:\n[stypendia@kozminski.edu.pl](mailto: stypendia@kozminski.edu.pl)\n\n",

Good behaviour during online classes.\n\n**BEFORE CLASSES:**\n\n  * Check your university mailbox and the Virtual University account **on a regular basis**. This is where you\u2019ll find all the necessary information about the upcoming online classes planned by your teacher(s).\n  *  **Make sure you\u2019re prepared technologically -** install the relevant app and test it - [installing MS Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/pl-pl/microsoft-365/microsoft-teams/download-app). Join the right Team by following a [link or using the code ](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/use-a-link-or-code-to-join-a-team-c957af50-df15-46e3-b5c4-067547b64548?ui=en-us&rs=en-us&ad=us) obtained from the course instructor.

You can have something to drink, something to make notes, and other study aids the course instructor may ask you to have.\n  *  **Become familiar with the** [\"Rules of attending classes taught with the use of distance education methods and techniques at Kozminski University\"](https://kozminski.sharepoint.com/:b:/s/ProjektwdroeniaSalesforce/EexJm9JnntBFt6Ry8dn0ToIBPXUjdNPx--9dHFXfTLGiSw?e=UbWcQn)\n\n**DURING CLASSES:**\n\n  * **Camera** \\- when the camera is on, it becomes an \u2018open\u2019 communication channel, and communication is a guarantee of the right quality in online education. We encourage you to take part in classes using also webcams. Teachers find it much easier to deliver classes if they see who they talk to. If you do feel uneasy, you can switch your camera off, but bear in mind you may be asked to turn it on at some point during the class.\n  *  **Microphone** \\- your **microphone should be muted** during the class. You **unmute** it **only when you want to speak** \\- and then you mute it again.\n  *  **Speaking** \\- if you wish to say something, you should use the MS Teams\u2019 \u201craise hand\u201d feature. The instructor will notice your activity and let you speak at the right moment or right away.\n  *  **Recording meetings** \\- the course instructor may decide to make your meeting recorded - after communicating their intention to you in advance. It won\u2019t be published anywhere without your consent. It will only be available to your group. **Don\u2019t record the meeting without the instructor\u2019s permission.**\n  *  **Don\u2019t try to take control of the displayed presentation! -** if you happen to take control over the presented content by accident, apologise and notify the instructor of the fact immediately.\n  *  **Breaks** \u2013 when there is a break, you may stay disconnect or stay connected. In the latter case, make sure your microphone is muted.\n  *  **Division into groups** \\- during classes, you may be assigned to project groups of several persons. The workflow for groups is arranged with the instructor, e.g. via Teams in special sub-teams/rooms or in some other convenient form. If the system gets disconnected for some reason or you don\u2019t return to the group after a finished exercise, \u201cre-join\u201d the meeting.\n  *  **Ask questions!** \\- if there\u2019s something you don\u2019t understand, don\u2019t be afraid to ask questions. Teachers want you to understand the content covered. Online classes are still classes after all. :)\n\n**IN COMMUNICATION:**\n\n  * **Stay up-to-date** \\- check your mailbox and MS Teams account on a regular basis.\n  *  **Make it easier to identify your problem** \\- when sending an e-mail, specify the course and the group (date and time of classes) your case concerns, as well as the mode, the level, and the field of study/programme. When you send your message from your university mailbox, you don\u2019t have to provide your student ID number.\n  *  **Be respectful in communication** \\- start your message from \u201cDear (academic title of the course instructor)\u201d and end it with \u201cYours sincerely\u201d.\n  *  **Be moderate** \\- don\u2019t use several different channels at once (e.g. e-mail, MS Teams chat, etc.) to communicate with one person over a short period of time.\n\n**IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS OR EXPERIENCE ISSUES:**\n\nIf you have any additional questions regarding online classes, please contact\nus at [online@kozminski.edu.pl](mailto:online@kozminski.edu.pl)\n\nIf you experience any technical issues using MS Teams, please contact us at:\n[help@kozminski.edu.pl](mailto:help@kozminski.edu.pl)  \n\n*The article was written based on resources compiled and provided by Krzysztof Ku\u017amicz, PhD, and Anna Pa\u0142yga, MSc, within the framework of the programme entitled: \u201cMethodology of Studying in a Digital Education Environment\u201d, and on the basis of \u201cNetykieta\u201d by Bo\u017cena Wujec and Lidia Czarkowska, PhD.\n\n",

[On-line Courses](/s/topic/0TO2o000000ADyRGAW/online-courses \"On-line Courses\")\n\n# Netiquette. Good behaviour during online classes.\n\n**BEFORE CLASSES:**\n\n  * Check your university mailbox and the Virtual University account **on a regular basis**. This is where you\u2019ll find all the necessary information about the upcoming online classes planned by your teacher(s).\n  *  **Make sure you\u2019re prepared technologically -** install the relevant app and test it - [installing MS Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/pl-pl/microsoft-365/microsoft-teams/download-app). Join the right Team by following a [link or using the code ](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/use-a-link-or-code-to-join-a-team-c957af50-df15-46e3-b5c4-067547b64548?ui=en-us&rs=en-us&ad=us) obtained from the course instructor. If necessary, make yourself familiar with the [Detailed guide to MS Teams.](https://kozminski.sharepoint.com/:b:/s/ProjektwdroeniaSalesforce/EZtiEQ8ac-lHkgYSre4Td2UBz3nfAGAGAlLx141U8IV9Ag?e=CNGZj2)\n  *  **Make yourself comfortable** \\- find a convenient place to sit with your computer, have your charger nearby (preferably connected to the computer). You can have something to drink, something to make notes, and other study aids the course instructor may ask you to have.\n  *  **Become familiar with the** [\"Rules of attending classes taught with the use of distance education methods and techniques at Kozminski University\"](https://kozminski.sharepoint.com/:b:/s/ProjektwdroeniaSalesforce/EexJm9JnntBFt6Ry8dn0ToIBPXUjdNPx--9dHFXfTLGiSw?e=UbWcQn)\n\n**DURING CLASSES:**\n\n  * **Camera** \\- when the camera is on, it becomes an \u2018open\u2019 communication channel, and communication is a guarantee of the right quality in online education. We encourage you to take part in classes using also webcams. Teachers find it much easier to deliver classes if they see who they talk to. If you do feel uneasy, you can switch your camera off, but bear in mind you may be asked to turn it on at some point during the class.\n  *  **Microphone** \\- your **microphone should be muted** during the class. You **unmute** it **only when you want to speak** \\- and then you mute it again.\n  *  **Speaking** \\- if you wish to say something, you should use the MS Teams\u2019 \u201craise hand\u201d feature. The instructor will notice your activity and let you speak at the right moment or right away.\n  *  **Recording meetings** \\- the course instructor may decide to make your meeting recorded - after communicating their intention to you in advance. It won\u2019t be published anywhere without your consent. It will only be available to your group. **Don\u2019t record the meeting without the instructor\u2019s permission.**\n  *  **Don\u2019t try to take control of the displayed presentation! -** if you happen to take control over the presented content by accident, apologise and notify the instructor of the fact immediately.\n  *  **Breaks** \u2013 when there is a break, you may stay disconnect or stay connected. In the latter case, make sure your microphone is muted.\n  *  **Division into groups** \\- during classes, you may be assigned to project groups of several persons. The workflow for groups is arranged with the instructor, e.g. via Teams in special sub-teams/rooms or in some other convenient form. If the system gets disconnected for some reason or you don\u2019t return to the group after a finished exercise, \u201cre-join\u201d the meeting.\n  *  **Ask questions!** \\- if there\u2019s something you don\u2019t understand, don\u2019t be afraid to ask questions. Teachers want you to understand the content covered. Online classes are still classes after all. :)\n\n**IN COMMUNICATION:**\n\n  * **Stay up-to-date** \\- check your mailbox and MS Teams account on a regular basis.\n  *  **Make it easier to identify your problem** \\- when sending an e-mail, specify the course and the group (date and time of classes) your case concerns, as well as the mode, the level, and the field of study/programme. When you send your message from your university mailbox, you don\u2019t have to provide your student ID number.\n  *  **Be respectful in communication** \\- start your message from \u201cDear (academic title of the course instructor)\u201d and end it with \u201cYours sincerely\u201d.\n  *  **Be moderate** \\- don\u2019t use several different channels at once (e.g. e-mail, MS Teams chat, etc.) to communicate with one person over a short period of time.\n\n**IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS OR EXPERIENCE ISSUES:**\n\nIf you have any additional questions regarding online classes, please contact\nus at [online@kozminski.edu.pl](mailto:online@kozminski.edu.pl)\n\nIf you experience any technical issues using MS Teams, please contact us at:\n[help@kozminski.edu.pl](mailto:help@kozminski.edu.pl)  \n\n*The article was written based on resources compiled and provided by Krzysztof Ku\u017amicz, PhD, and Anna Pa\u0142yga, MSc, within the framework of the programme entitled: \u201cMethodology of Studying in a Digital Education Environment\u201d, and on the basis of \u201cNetykieta\u201d by Bo\u017cena Wujec and Lidia Czarkowska, PhD.\n\n",
